Application takes 4 inputs from the user. Name, email, password, and confirm password.
Then it checks if all spaces are filled in. If any arn't it displays an error message.
If the passwords don't match, you get an error message. If there are no errors it makes a
toast welcoming the user using their name that they entered.
